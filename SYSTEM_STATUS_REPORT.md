## 🔧 WHAT'S WORKING
1. ✅ Load balancing between Current Server and Server 1
2. ✅ MongoDB replica set with Primary + 1 Secondary
3. ✅ Read queries can be distributed to secondary
4. ✅ Backend servers 1 & 2 running

## ⚠️ WHAT NEEDS FIXING
1. ❌ Server 2 backend not accessible (firewall/security group)
2. ❌ Server 2 MongoDB not in replica set
3. ❌ Load not distributed to Server 2

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS
1. Fix Server 2 backend accessibility
2. Add Server 2 MongoDB to replica set
3. Verify load distribution across all 3 servers
