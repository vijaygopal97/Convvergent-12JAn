# MongoDB Replica Set Setup - Gradual Migration (Zero Downtime)

## Current Situation
- **Primary Server**: 13.202.181.167 (172.31.43.71) - Currently running standalone MongoDB
- **Secondary Server**: 3.109.82.159 (172.31.47.152) - Fresh MongoDB installation
- **Issue**: Old replica set config has unreachable members, preventing proper setup

## Zero Downtime Strategy

### Phase 1: Keep Current Setup Running (DONE ✅)
- Current server continues as standalone MongoDB
- All backend services running normally
- No changes to production system

### Phase 2: Setup New Server as Standalone First
1. Configure new server MongoDB as standalone (no replica set)
2. Use MongoDB's initial sync or mongodump/mongorestore to copy data
3. Verify data integrity on new server

### Phase 3: Convert to Replica Set (Minimal Downtime)
1. Brief maintenance window (< 5 minutes)
2. Initialize replica set on primary
3. Add secondary to replica set
4. MongoDB performs automatic initial sync
5. Verify replication working

### Phase 4: Load Balancing Setup
1. Configure nginx load balancer
2. Sync backend code to new server
3. Update connection strings gradually
4. Test load balancing

## Next Steps

We'll use MongoDB's built-in replication with proper initial sync, which is the safest approach.
