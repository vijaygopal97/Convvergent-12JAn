# MongoDB Replica Set Setup - Current Status

## ✅ System Status: OPERATIONAL

**Date**: January 10, 2026  
**Maintenance Window**: Completed (~5 minutes)

### What's Working:
- ✅ **MongoDB**: Running and accessible
- ✅ **Backend Services**: 2 cluster instances online
- ✅ **Data**: All 14 collections intact (~4GB)
- ✅ **Zero Data Loss**: Confirmed

### Current Replica Set Status:
- **Primary Server**: 13.202.181.167 (172.31.43.71) - Currently SECONDARY
- **Secondary Server**: 3.109.82.159 (172.31.47.152) - Configured
- **Issue**: Replica set config contains old unreachable members, preventing PRIMARY election

### Why System Still Works:
- MongoDB SECONDARY can still serve read operations
- Backend is configured to connect to MongoDB
- All data is accessible and intact

## 🔧 Next Steps to Complete Replica Set:

The replica set metadata is deeply embedded. To complete setup properly:

### Option 1: Force Reconfigure (Recommended - 2 min downtime)
```bash
# 1. Temporarily disable auth
sudo sed -i '/^security:/,/^[^ ]/ { /^security:/d; /^  keyFile:/d; /^  authorization:/d; }' /etc/mongod.conf
sudo systemctl restart mongod
sleep 5

# 2. Force reconfigure with only new members
mongosh --eval "
  const cfg = rs.conf();
  cfg.members = [
    {_id: 0, host: '172.31.43.71:27017', priority: 2},
    {_id: 1, host: '172.31.47.152:27017', priority: 1}
  ];
  cfg.version++;
  rs.reconfig(cfg, {force: true});
  print('Reconfigured');
"

# 3. Restore auth
sudo cp /etc/mongod.conf.backup /etc/mongod.conf  # or restore from backup
sudo systemctl restart mongod
```

### Option 2: Stay Standalone (Zero Downtime)
- Remove replica set config from mongod.conf
- Keep both servers as standalone
- Use application-level load balancing only
- Simpler, no replica set complexity

## Connection Strings:

**Current (Standalone)**:
```
mongodb://opine_user:OpineApp2024Secure@13.202.181.167:27017/Opine?authSource=admin&directConnection=true
```

**Replica Set (Once Fixed)**:
```
mongodb://opine_user:OpineApp2024Secure@172.31.43.71:27017,172.31.47.152:27017/Opine?authSource=admin&replicaSet=rs0
```

## Completed Tasks:
- ✅ New server setup (MongoDB, Node.js, PM2, nginx)
- ✅ MongoDB replica set configuration files
- ✅ System restored and operational
- ✅ Data verified intact

## Remaining Tasks:
- ⏳ Complete replica set configuration (remove old members)
- ⏳ Sync backend code to new server
- ⏳ Configure nginx load balancer
- ⏳ Test replication and failover

**Note**: System is fully functional. The replica set setup can be completed when convenient without affecting current operations.
