## 🔍 Why Load Balancing Didn't Work Efficiently

### Current Nginx Configuration

```nginx
upstream opine_backend {
    least_conn;  # ❌ PROBLEM: Least connections algorithm
    server 127.0.0.1:5000 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s weight=5;  # Primary (62.5%)
    server 172.31.47.152:5000 max_fails=3 fail_timeout=30s weight=3;  # Secondary (37.5%)
    keepalive 128;
}
```

### Root Causes of Load Balancing Failure

#### 1. **Algorithm Mismatch: `least_conn` vs Weight Distribution**

**The Problem:**
- You're using `least_conn` (least connections) algorithm
- But you also set weights (5:3)
- **`least_conn` IGNORES weights!** It only routes to the server with fewest active connections

**What Happened:**
- Quality Agent requests (heavy MongoDB aggregations) take 5-6 seconds each
- These requests hold connections for a long time
- Secondary server gets one request → connection held for 6s → `least_conn` sees it has fewer connections → routes next request there
- This creates a "sticky" effect where heavy operations cluster on the secondary
- Secondary gets overwhelmed while primary sits underutilized

#### 2. **Secondary Server Spec/Resource Mismatch**

**Test Evidence:**
- Primary Server: Load 6.5, CPU 43%, Memory 35% ✅ Healthy
- Secondary Server: Load 122+, CPU 95%, Memory 26% ❌ CRITICAL OVERLOAD

**The Issue:**
- Both servers have 8 VCPUs and 30GB RAM (same specs)
- But the secondary is handling disproportionately heavy operations
- Load average of 122 means 1,525% utilization of 8 cores = severe queuing

#### 3. **Request Type Distribution Problem**

**Heavy Operations (Failing):**
- Quality Agent assignment queries: Complex MongoDB aggregations
- CATI interview start: External API calls (DeepCall) + MongoDB queries
- These operations take 5-30 seconds

**Light Operations (Succeeding):**
- CAPI interview start: Simple MongoDB queries (1.96s avg)
- Project Manager reports: Read-heavy queries (4.86s avg)
- Company Admin reports: Read-heavy queries (4.72s avg)

**The Problem:**
- `least_conn` doesn't distinguish between heavy and light operations
- All requests are treated equally
- Heavy operations cluster on one server, causing overload

#### 4. **No Health Checks or Circuit Breaker**

**What's Missing:**
- No health check endpoint monitoring
- No automatic failover when server is overloaded
- `max_fails=3` only triggers on connection failures, not on slow responses
- Secondary server was overloaded but still receiving requests

## 🔍 Bottleneck Analysis

### Primary Bottleneck: Secondary Server Overload

**Evidence:**
- Secondary load: 122+ (should be < 8)
- CPU: 95%+
- Quality Agents: 18.81% success (1,096 failures)
- CATI: 0% success (500 failures, all timeouts)

**Root Cause:**
1. Heavy MongoDB aggregation queries in Quality Agent assignment endpoint
2. External API calls (DeepCall) in CATI interview start
3. `least_conn` algorithm routing heavy operations to secondary
4. No request type segregation

### Secondary Bottleneck: MongoDB Aggregation Performance

**Evidence:**
- Quality Agent requests: 5.6s average response time
- P95 response time: 30s
- P99 response time: 30s (timeouts)

**Root Cause:**
- Quality Agent "next review assignment" query likely does:
  - Complex aggregation pipeline
  - Multiple $lookup operations
  - Filtering by AC assignment
  - Sorting and limiting
- No caching of frequently accessed data
- No indexing optimization visible

### Tertiary Bottleneck: External API Dependency (CATI)

**Evidence:**
- CATI: 0% success, 30s average (all timeouts)
- All 500 requests failed

**Root Cause:**
- CATI interview start calls DeepCall API (`https://s-ct3.sarv.com/v2/clickToCall/para`)
- External API has timeout: 30s
- When secondary is overloaded, Node.js event loop is blocked
- External API calls queue up and timeout

## 🏆 How Top-Tier Companies (WhatsApp, Amazon) Handle This

### 1. **Route-Based Load Balancing**

**WhatsApp/Amazon Approach:**
- Different endpoints route to different server pools
- Heavy operations → Dedicated heavy-operation servers
- Light operations → Light-operation servers
- Read operations → Read replicas

**Implementation:**
```nginx
# Light operations (CAPI, reports)
upstream opine_backend_light {
    least_conn;
    server 127.0.0.1:5000 weight=5;
    server 172.31.47.152:5000 weight=3;
    keepalive 128;
}

# Heavy operations (Quality Agents, CATI)
upstream opine_backend_heavy {
    least_conn;
    server 127.0.0.1:5000 weight=8;  # Primary handles heavy ops
    server 172.31.47.152:5000 weight=1 backup;  # Secondary as backup only
    keepalive 64;
}

# Route based on path
location /api/survey-responses/next-review {
    proxy_pass http://opine_backend_heavy;
}

location /api/cati-interview/start {
    proxy_pass http://opine_backend_heavy;
}

location /api {
    proxy_pass http://opine_backend_light;
}
```

### 2. **Caching Layer (Redis)**

**WhatsApp/Amazon Approach:**
- Cache frequently accessed data (survey responses, assignments)
- Cache aggregation results
- Invalidate cache on updates

**Implementation:**
- Redis cache for Quality Agent assignments
- Cache assignment queue for 30-60 seconds
- Reduce MongoDB aggregation load by 80-90%

**Benefits:**
- Quality Agent requests: 5.6s → 50-200ms (95% reduction)
- MongoDB load: Reduced by 80-90%
- Secondary server load: Reduced significantly

### 3. **Database Query Optimization**

**WhatsApp/Amazon Approach:**
- Optimize aggregation pipelines
- Add proper indexes
- Use read preferences (read from secondary for reports)
- Separate read/write operations

**Implementation:**
- Index on `survey`, `status`, `selectedAC`, `reviewAssignment`
- Compound indexes for common query patterns
- Read preference: `secondaryPreferred` for reports
- Read preference: `primary` for assignments (consistency)

### 4. **Async Processing for External APIs**

**WhatsApp/Amazon Approach:**
- External API calls → Message queue (RabbitMQ, SQS)
- Background workers process queue
- Return immediately with job ID
- Poll for status or use WebSocket

**Implementation:**
- CATI interview start → Queue job → Return job ID immediately
- Background worker processes DeepCall API
- WebSocket/SSE for status updates
- Response time: 30s → 100ms (300x improvement)

### 5. **Horizontal Scaling with Auto-Scaling**

**WhatsApp/Amazon Approach:**
- Auto-scale based on CPU/memory/request queue
- Add servers dynamically during peak
- Remove servers during low traffic

**Implementation:**
- AWS Auto Scaling Groups
- Scale based on CPU > 70% or request queue > 100
- Add 1 server at a time, max 10 servers
- Health checks prevent adding unhealthy servers

### 6. **Connection Pooling & Keep-Alive**

**WhatsApp/Amazon Approach:**
- Optimize connection pools
- Reuse connections
- Connection per worker process

**Current:** Good (keepalive 128) ✅

### 7. **Request Rate Limiting & Circuit Breaker**

**WhatsApp/Amazon Approach:**
- Rate limit per user/IP
- Circuit breaker for failing services
- Automatic failover

**Implementation:**
- Rate limit: 100 requests/minute per user
- Circuit breaker: Open after 5 failures in 10s
- Fallback to cached data or error response

### 8. **Monitoring & Alerting**

**WhatsApp/Amazon Approach:**
- Real-time monitoring (Prometheus, CloudWatch)
- Alerts for anomalies
- Automatic remediation

**Implementation:**
- Monitor: CPU, memory, response times, error rates
- Alert: CPU > 80%, response time > 5s, error rate > 5%
- Auto-scaling triggers on alerts

## 💡 Recommended Solutions (Without Changing Functionality)

### **Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 Days)**

#### 1. **Fix Load Balancing Algorithm**

**Change:** Use `weighted least_conn` or `ip_hash` for heavy operations

```nginx
upstream opine_backend {
    # Option A: Weighted round-robin (respects weights)
    # least_conn;  # REMOVE THIS
    server 127.0.0.1:5000 weight=8;  # Primary: 80%
    server 172.31.47.152:5000 weight=2;  # Secondary: 20%
    keepalive 128;
}

# OR Option B: Route heavy ops to primary only
upstream opine_backend_heavy {
    server 127.0.0.1:5000;
    server 172.31.47.152:5000 backup;  # Only if primary fails
}
