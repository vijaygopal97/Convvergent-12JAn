## How to Monitor Progress

### Quick Status Check:
```bash
cd /var/www/opine/stress-tests/situation-1-quality-checks
./check-status.sh
```

### Monitor Live (if test is running):
```bash
# Watch log file
tail -f /var/www/opine/stress-tests/situation-1-quality-checks/logs/comprehensive-5min-*.log

# Watch metrics CSV
tail -f /var/www/opine/stress-tests/situation-1-quality-checks/reports/metrics-comprehensive-5min-*.csv
```

### Check System Performance:
```bash
# CPU and Memory
top

# Load average
uptime

# Memory details
free -h

# Network connections
ss -tn | grep ESTAB | wc -l
```

## Next Steps

1. **Check if test data needs cleanup:**
   ```bash
   cd /var/www/opine/stress-tests/situation-1-quality-checks/scripts
   node cleanup-all-test-data.js
   ```

2. **Restart test if needed:**
   ```bash
   cd /var/www/opine/stress-tests/situation-1-quality-checks/scripts
   timeout 400 node comprehensive-5min-stress-test.js 2>&1 | tee ../logs/comprehensive-5min-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log
   ```

3. **Monitor progress:**
   ```bash
   ./check-status.sh
   ```
